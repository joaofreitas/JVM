Steps the virtual machine: loading, linking, initialization and invoke the main method processes that are described further in later sections.

  1. Loading - ClassLoader
  2. Linking - Involves verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution
    2.1 - Verification: checks that the loaded is well formed, with a proper symbol table. Verification also checks that the code obeys the semantic requirements of JVM
    2.2 - Preparation: involves allocation of static storage and any data structures that are used internally by the virtual machine, such as method tables.
    2.3 - Resolution (optionally): is the process of checking symbolic references from a class to other classes and interfaces, by loading the
other classes and interfaces that are mentioned and checking that the references are correct.
  3. Initialization consists of execution of any class variable initializers and static initializers of the class, in textual order. But before the class can be 
initialized, its direct superclass must be initialized.
  4. Invoke the main method: The method main of class is invoked.
